    "We simulate attacks on the darknet network, using targeted or random attacks. We try to see how do key network metrics, such as centrality measures, community size and connectivity change when the most central nodes are removed from the network, compared to random removals. Our narrative is helping the police in tackling the ever lasting difficulties of taking down illicit websites. We also implement recoveries, where nodes have certain chances to come back based on different criteria. We measure different metrics during the simulation and plot them in the end to gain insight into the effectivness of our attacks."
